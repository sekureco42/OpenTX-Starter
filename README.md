# OpenTX Tutorial

While surfing the net I learned in late march about the new Radiomaster TX16s. So in late april I ordered one. This is my first OpenTX based radio. I was a little bit overhelmed about this eco system - no clue where to start. To help others I will document my steps which I did as a help for other "newbies".
