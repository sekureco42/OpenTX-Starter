# OpenTX Starter

## Introduction

While surfing the net I learned in late march about the new Radiomaster TX16s. So in late april I ordered one. This is my first OpenTX based radio. I was a little bit overhelmed about this eco system - no clue where to start. To help others I will document my steps which I did as a help for other "newbies".

## About me

I'm a heli pilot since many years - my skills are enough for flying around and do some simple manouvers like turns and loops. I started with an Spektrum DX7 radio. Then many started to use telemetry - no chance with my DX7 so I switched to Futaba TG14s - a nice radio and I was quite happy with it. Finally I wanted to have a high end radio so I bought a Jeti DS14 - really nice piece of hardware. But unfortnuatly this radio was too big for me and I crashed three models.

Due I also like to do FPV I was aware that there an alternative eco system is available: Cheap radio's based on OpenTX. I like Open Source projects and then I came across an announcment from Radiomaster that they will release the TX16s - as soon as I heard of that \(april 2020\) I did a pre-order. Finally on 8th of july 2020 the package arrived....

...and I had a lot of question marks: What I have to do it with it now? Where to start? What has to be done first? I checked available information in the internet - you will find many interesting information. But if you are beginner like me in the OpenTX environment you will get lost soon.

With this documents I will help others to have a smoother start into OpenTX. Feedback is welcome!
