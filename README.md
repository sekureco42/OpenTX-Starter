# OpenTX Starter

Book published under [https://sekureco42.gitbook.io/opentx-starter/](https://sekureco42.gitbook.io/opentx-starter/)

## Introduction

I'm a heli pilot since many years - my skills are enough for flying around and do some simple manouvers like turns and loops. I started with an Spektrum DX7 radio. Then many started to use telemetry - no chance with my DX7 so I switched to Futaba TG14s - a nice radio and I was quite happy with it. Finally I wanted to have a high end radio so I bought a Jeti DS14 - really nice piece of hardware. But unfortnuatly this radio was too big for me and I crashed three models.

Due I also like to do FPV I was aware that there is an alternative eco system is available: Cheap radio's based on OpenTX. I like Open Source projects and then I came across an announcment from Radiomaster that they will release the TX16s - as soon as I heard of that \(april 2020\) I did a pre-order. Finally on 8th of july 2020 the package arrived....

...and I had a lot of question marks: What I have to do it with it now? Where to start? What has to be done first? I checked available information in the internet - you will find many interesting information. But if you are beginner like me in the OpenTX environment you will get lost soon.

With this documents I will help others to have a smoother start into OpenTX. Feedback is welcome!
